      Vagabond is japanese manga series written and illustrated by Takehiko
      Inoue. <br /><br />
      The story starts in 1600, in the aftermath of the decisive Battle of
      Sekigahara. Two 17-year-old teenagers who joined the losing side, Takez≈ç
      Shinmen and Matahachi Hon'iden, lie wounded in the battlefield and pursued
      by survivor hunters. They manage to escape and swear to become "Invincible
      Under The Heavens"
      <br /><br />
      Vagabond is my top 2 favorite manga because I really like its philosophy,
      art, quotes, and action scenes throughout the series.
