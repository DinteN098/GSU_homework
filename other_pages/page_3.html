      Berserk is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Kentaro
      Miura. Set in a medieval Europe–inspired dark fantasy world
      <br /><br />
      Guts is born from the corpse of his hanged mother and raised by Gambino,
      an abusive mercenary captain. After Gambino's death, Guts becomes a
      wandering warrior whose combat prowess attracts Griffith, leader of the
      Band of the Hawk. Griffith defeats him in battle and compels him to join
      the mercenary group. During his time with the Hawks, Guts learns of
      Griffith's ambition to rule a kingdom and the mysterious Crimson Behelit
      he possesses. The demonic warrior Nosferatu Zodd spares their lives upon
      recognizing the Behelit, warning Guts that his bond with Griffith will
      bring calamity.

      I chose the previous two manga based on personal preference, but Berserk
      might be one of the greatest manga I have ever read. The characters, the
      plot, the illustrations—everything about this manga feels perfect. If I
      had to stay with only one of these three stories, I would definitely
      choose this one.
