      The Climber is a Japanese manga series written by Shin-ichi Sakamoto,
      Yoshio Nabeta (first two volumes), and Hiroshi Takano (volumes 2–4), and
      illustrated by Sakamoto, based on a two-volume 1973 novel by Jirō Nitta.
      <br /><br />
      The story follows a lonesome and "gloomy" student named Mori Buntarō and
      his journey from the discovery of his new passion, climbing, starting from
      a high school climbing club, to being a world class professional climber.
      Going through the different stages of his life dealing with loneliness,
      solo climbing, and depression, in pursuit of his dream, conquering the
      most difficult mountain, K2.

      At the moment, The Climber is my number one favorite manga because the
      story and illustrations are outstanding. This manga is so good that it
      even got me into climbing for a while. I’ve even read it a second time!
